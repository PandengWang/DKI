# Quest for keystone species in microbial communities 
We have tested this code for Python 3.8.13 and R 4.1.2.

## This repository contains:
(1) A synthetic dataset to test the Data-driven Keystone species Identification (DKI) framework.

(2) Python code to predict the species composition using species assemblage (cNODE2) and R code to compute keystoneness.

(3) Predicted species composition after removing each present species in each sample.

## How the use the DKI framework.
(1) Run "DKI.py" to predict species compostion using species assemblage.
(2) Run "Keystoness_computing.R" to compute the keystoneness.
